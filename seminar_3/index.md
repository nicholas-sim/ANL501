## Seminar 3


We present the fundamental syntax and functionalities of _ggplot_. The syntax of _ggplot_ adheres to the principles of the Grammar of Graphics for data visualization. First, we demonstrate how data visualization is constructing using _ggplot_ through an example. Then, we explore the proper utilization of the aesthetic layer and other various layers of _ggplot_.

We explore the basic syntax and functionalities of *ggplot*. We discuss how the *ggplot* syntax is structured around the different layers of the Grammar of Graphics. We explore the difference between declaring the data and parameters globally versus locally and how to easily overlay a basic plot with trendlines and colors. Finally, we explain how we may use *gganimate* to easily generate animations for a static plot.

We discuss the difference between an aesthetic and setting in *ggplot* and how to use them correctly to enhance a data visualization for storytelling. We explore the main features in a plot that can be declared as an aesthetic or a setting, such as color, fill, size, among others.

We explore other optional layers in the Grammar of Graphics that are often used to improve the effectiveness of a data visualization. This includes the use of scales, coordinates, labels, statistics, facets, and theme. The discussion concludes with an example of how to employ some of these various elements for visualization.
