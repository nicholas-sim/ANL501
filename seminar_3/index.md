## Seminar 3


This seminar presents the fundamental syntax and functionalities of _ggplot_. The syntax of _ggplot_ adheres to the principles of the Grammar of Graphics for data visualization. First, through an example, we demonstrate how to construct a visualization using _ggplot_. Then, we explore the proper utilization of the aesthetic layer and other various layers of _ggplot_.

This discussion focuses on the basic syntax and functionalities of *ggplot*. We discuss how the *ggplot* syntax is structured around the different layers expressed by the Grammar of Graphics. We discuss the basic differences between declaring the data and parameters globally versus locally and to syntax to overlay various layers such as trendlines and colors onto the base plot. The discussion concludes by demonstrating the visualization capabilities of R, such as the *gganimate* package, which easily produces animations for a static plot.

This discussion explains the differences between an aesthetic and setting in the language of *ggplot* and how to use them correctly to enhance a data visualization for storytelling. Through an example, we explore how data storytelling can be enhanced by the appropriate use of aesthetics or settings, such as color, fill, size, among others.

This discussion explores other optional layers in the Grammar of Graphics that are often used to improve the effectiveness of a data visualization. This includes the use of scales, coordinates, labels, statistics, facets, and theme. The discussion concludes with an example of how to employ some of these various elements for visualization.
