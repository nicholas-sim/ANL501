## Seminar 5

This seminar first explores the importance of data preprocessing for data visualizations. Data preprocessing, which includes feature engineering and data reshaping, could be necessary to achieve visualizations that convey a specific data story. Following which, we explore visualizations that facilitate the comparison of distributions across groups, such as boxplots, dotplots, jitter plots, ridge plots, as well as treemaps, which display rankings and hierarchical structures in a variable. We then consider employing text elements, such as labels and annotations, to improve storytelling in data visualizations. Finally, we explore the visualization of geospatial data through chloropelth maps, which where regions or areas on the map are colored in proportion to the values of a variable of interest.

Table data are data summarized in a table. This discussion explores how table data can be constructed using a column plot. It then illustrates the importance of data preprocessing to obtain certain bar charts that cannot be constructed by direct application of standard _ggplot_ functions. It continues to explore the importance of data preprocessing, and how data story can be visualized by first employing feature engineering and data

This discussion focuses on data visualizations that compare distributions across groups. These visualizations include boxplots, which provide visualizations of key summary statistics of a numerical variable, dotplots and jitter plots, which employ points to show incidences of a variable, among others. The discussion concludes with a brief discussion of treemaps, which are useful for showing the rankings or hierarchical structures of attributes within a variable.

Labels and annotations can be used to clarify certain features in a data visualization. For instance, labels can be used to identify important points in a scatter plot, while annotations can be used to mark areas corresponding to recessionary periods in time series plot, or as text to highlight important events captured by a data visualization.

A choropleth map is a thematic map where regions or areas on the map are colored in proportion to the values of a variable of interest. This is useful for understanding the distribution of a variable across space, such as, the distribution of GDP per capita across countries, voting patterns across states, etc. This discussion first begins with a discussion of map data, how such data may be formatted. It then explores the main aesthetics in the function, `geom_polygon`, and their purposes for the successful construction of a chloropleth map. We round up with a brief discussion of the simple features data frame and chloropleth maps can be constructed using such data.
