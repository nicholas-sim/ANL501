## Seminar 2

Establishing a solid foundation in R programming entails comprehending data frame management with base R, despite the straightforward syntax of _dplyr_ to handle data. Therefore, this seminar will delve into utilizing both base R and _Tidyverse_ for effective data management. Additionally, we will explore the principles of the Grammar of Graphics and explore their significance in providing a structured approach for crafting compelling data visualizations.

We explore the _dyplr_ package from _tidyverse_ for data wrangling. We cover several main commands, including _fliter_, _select_, _summarise_, _mutate_, and other useful functions in _dplyr_.
