## Seminar 2

Building complex data visualizations in R requires proficiency in efficient data handling using both base R commands and the user-friendly syntax of _dplyr_. This seminar provides a guide on the utilization of both base R and _Tidyverse_ methods for effective data management. Along with building up the skills for data management in R, the seminar will introduce the principles of the Grammar of Graphics and explain its role in providing a structured approach for constructing data visualizations for storytelling.
