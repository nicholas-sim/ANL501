## Introduction to R
This is the introduction to R programming. There are two parts: Operations and Programming.

### Operations
This discussion data types, the combine functions, vectors and matrices, array indexing, and conditional filtering.


### Programming
The discussion first begins with the concept of a list. Then, it covers basic programming fundamentals related to flow controls and function writing. For flow controls we cover the _for_ statement, the if, _else if_ and _else_ statements, and _while_ statements. For functions, we explore the standard syntax and documentations for writing functions with multiple inputs and outputs.
