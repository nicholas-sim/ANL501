## Seminar 1

Here is the <a style="font-weight:bold"  href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/seminar_1/introduction"> overview </a> of the course. By the end of the course, students will become proficient (with effort) in using R for data cleaning, data visualisation, and writing reproducible reports using RMarkdown. As stucents are not expected to have prior knowledge in R, we will start off with the basics in R operations and progtamming.

The discussion first begins with the concept of a list. Then, it covers basic programming fundamentals related to flow controls and function writing. For flow controls we cover the _for_ statement, the if, _else if_ and _else_ statements, and _while_ statements. For functions, we explore the standard syntax and documentations for writing functions with multiple inputs and outputs.

This discussion is based Cole Nussbaum-Knaflic's book <a href="https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/"> Storytelling with Data </a>. Here, we explore several key considerations when constructing a data visualization for storytelling, such as the reduction of clutter, carful use of colors, paying attention to preattentive attributes, among others.
