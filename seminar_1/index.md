## Seminar 1

Here is the <a style="font-weight:bold"  href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/seminar_1/introduction"> overview </a> of the course. By the end of the course, students will become proficient (with effort) in using R for data cleaning, data visualisation, and writing reproducible reports using RMarkdown. As students are not expected to have the prior knowledge in R (although it would be helpful), we will start off with the basics in R operations and programming.

This discussion data types, the combine functions, vectors and matrices, array indexing, and conditional filtering.

The discussion first begins by explaining what a list is and its purpose. Then, it covers basic programming fundamentals related to flow controls and function writing. For flow controls, we will cover the _for_ statement, the _if_, _else if_ and _else_ statements, and _while_ statements. We will also cover other useful tools such as the _gsub_ and _grep_ functions, as well as _str_split_ function from the _dplyr_ package.

This discussion is based Cole Nussbaum-Knaflic's book <a href="https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/"> Storytelling with Data </a>. Here, we explore several key considerations when constructing a data visualization for storytelling, such as the reduction of clutter, strategic use of colors, paying attention to preattentive attributes, among others.
